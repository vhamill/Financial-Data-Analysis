Program.cs is my C# code which pulls financial data from the online CSV files and imports it into the database.

CreateTickers.sql and CreatePrices.sql are the SQL queries I used to create my two tables for storing the financial data: Tickers and Prices.

CreateGet52DayMovingAveragePrice.sql, CreateGet52DayHighPrice.sql, and CreateGet52DayLowPrice.sql are the SQL queries I used to create my stored procedures.
